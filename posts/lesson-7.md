Making it this far means you can play in nearly 75% of typical kirtans. we will start exploring the other 25% today.

Kirtans start slow, perhpas playing prabhupada tala or ta ke ke ta ge ge. then you may transition into kaherva. Then you may play double time.

Towards the end, when every one is up and dancing, we will explore this section now. It is typically a sign of changing form a 4 beat to a 3 beat. Dances are typically held in 3 beats (ie the waltz)

timing is very important

three beat (24 beats total)

ta - khe ta khe
ta - khe ta khe
ta - khe ta khe
ta ge ta ge (dha)


the ending dha replaces ta of every subsequent repetition, ie

ta - khe ta khe
ta - khe ta khe
ta - khe ta khe
ta ge ta ge 

dha - khe ta khe
ta - khe ta khe
ta - khe ta khe
ta ge ta ge (dha)

practice + Kirtan

12 beat variation

you are essentially playing the first line and then the last line

ta - khe ta khe
ta ge ta ge (dha)

note, you role the dha over to the next cycle, ie

ta - khe ta khe
ta ge ta ge 

dha - khe ta khe
ta ge ta ge 

the last hura! is just

ta ghe ta ghe 

we can further intensify this by doubling up on khes or ghes, shown with the first 24 beat

ta - khe ta khe
ta - khekhe ta khe
ta - khekhe ta khe
ta gege ta ge (dha)
