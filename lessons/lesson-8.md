In this lesson we will go over a variation of Prabhupada Tala and a new tihai. We will need two new bols.

### Daya Bols

**ri:** This bol is simply a closed *ta*. Strike the top half of the syahi with the index finger

### Combination Bols

**tiri:** This is a psuedo combination bol. It is *ti* and *ri* played back to back without a pause. Moving the hand in a scooping motion helps to play these bols in quick succession

    
### Prabhupada Tala Variation

If you notice, the variation comes in the last line of the mantra. The original last line was *ta - - ta* while the last line of the variation is *ti tiri tiri ta*.

        <td>khe ti</td> 
        <td>ghe dha</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>-</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ti</td> 
        <td>tiri</td> 
        <td>tiri</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
    </tr>
</table>


### New Tihai

The new tiha variation is also a simple change. Again, the tihai is a three beat with the last matra being a pause.  Recall what we learned about tihais in [Lesson 3](/lessons/three.html). The last matra of this tihai consumes the first matra of the subsequent mantra.

        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>jha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>jha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

# Suplement

In the suplement, we will practice singing the new Prabhupada Tala alongside the new tiahi.

*Note:* We sometimes add an extra *jha* to the end of the tihai. this needs a little bit of intuition to see where it belongs as sometimes it does not belong to the next cycle.
