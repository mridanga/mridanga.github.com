Making it this far means you can play in nearly 75% of typical kirtans. we will start exploring the other 25% today.

Kirtans start slow, perhaps playing Prabhupada Tala or *ta ke ke ta ge ge*. then you may transition into Kaherva. Then you may play double time.

Towards the end, when every one is up and dancing, we will explore this section now. It is typically a sign of changing form a 4 beat to a 3 beat. Dances are typically held in 3 beats (i.e. the waltz.)

You will notice that his mantra is in cycles of three instead of four (like Kaherva and Prabhupada Tala.) This is one of the reasons that this mantra has a fast energy to it. When practicing this mantra, it is beneficial to have Kartals accompanying you, keeping time. You can find a three beat Kartal clip at [KKSongs](http://kksongs.org/khol/chapters/lesson12.html).

### 24 Beat Mantra

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>ge ta</td> 
        <td>ge (dha)</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

Some things to note, the last matra of the last line has a *dha* in parenthesis. In this particular mantra, when played cyclicly, the last *dha* replaces the first matra of *ta*.

Here is an expanded cycle where the *dha* replaces the *ta*:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>ge ta</td> 
        <td>ge</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>*dha* -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>ge ta</td> 
        <td>ge</td> 
    </tr>
</table>


### 12 Beat Variation

To add a bit more excitement and speed, you can cut out the middle two lines of the original mantra making a 12 beat variation. Again, the last *dha* replaces the first *ta* when played cyclically.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>ge ta</td> 
        <td>ge (dha)</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

### The Three Beat Variation

To get *even more* excitement, you can just play a continual three beat. Use this sparingly when excitement is at a peak.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td>    
        <td>ghe ta</td>    
        <td>ghe</td>    
    </tr>
</table>

### The 24 Beat Doubletime

We can further intensify the original mantra by doubling up on *khes* or *ghes*, shown with the first 24 beat. You will notice that there are now three bols in certain matras; such as matra five (*khekhe ta*).

In this notation, when two bols are touching within a matra they are played immediately together. When there is a space, there is the slightest of pauses between them. This will become clearer in the video lesson.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khekhe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>khekhe ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta -</td> 
        <td>gege ta</td> 
        <td>ge (dha)</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
