The Mridanga has two faces, a large side called the **Baya** and a small side called the **Daya**. Typically the Daya is played with your dominant hand as it requires more intricate hand motions than the Baya does. The black / brown surfaces are called **Syahi**. The tan ring surrounding the syahi is called the **Maidan**.

Strikes on the two surfaces are called **Bols**. Bols can be either open (resonant), or closed (non-resonant). Furthermore, bols can be played on a single side of the Mridanga or simultaneously on both faces at once. Bols form their own alphabet, spelling out mantras as they are played. Just like any other language, bols have synonyms which aid in describing sounds. For example *ge* and *ghe* are synonyms for the same sound. Bols also have capitalizations, such as *ta* and *Ta*. *Ta* represents an emphasized *ta*. We will discuss each of these bols as we get to them. You can visit [the Bols page](/bols.html) at any time for a reference of all the bols.

When describing mirdanga tunes, **Mantras** are entire songs. **Matras** are individual notes within a mantra. It can be slightly confusing, so take care while reading. 

For this lesson, we will learn six bols:

### Daya Bols

**ta:**
This is an open, sharp strike with the index finger on the center of the **(Insert black name here)** of the Dayan.

**ti:**
This is a closed strike made with the pinky, ring, and middle finger. You strike the lower half of the **(black name)**.

### Baya Bols

**ge:**
This is an open strike with all five fingers. It is off center of the **(Black)**. This sound is what most people relate to when they hear the Mridanga. It should be a very deep, resonant boom.

**khe:**
This is a closed strike with all five fingers on the center of the **(black)**. The palm should not make contact. 


### Combination Bols

**dha:**
This is a combination of *ge* and *ta* played simultaneously. It is a fully resonant combination.

**dhe:**
This is a combination of *ge* and *ti* played simultaneously. It is a partially resonant combination.

A trick to remember combination bols is to look at the last few letters of the name. Bols ending in 'a' typically are open (i.e. *ta*) on the Daya. For example, *dha*, *jha*, *gha*, all are played with *ta.*

### Our First Mantra

This is a Very simple mantra used in some kirtans. **-** signifies a pause.
