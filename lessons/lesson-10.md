As the name implies, Bhajani Tala is typically used in bhajans over kirtans. There are some subtle differences between kirtan rhythms and bhajan rhythms. First, kirtans are typically loud as you have a large group of people singing call in response. To accommodate, the rhythms are also loud, **(??)** relying heavily on *ghe*.

Bhajans do not necessarily follow a call and response format. As a result, bhajans have the opportunity to have a subtle, soft, and complex nature. Bhajans also tend to exhibit an off-beat nature. This can be a little hard to pick up on paper, so be sure to listen carefully during the timing in the video.

The particular mantra we are learning today is typically used in a medium or fast section of a kirtan. It follows an eight beat cycle, the same as kaherva. You will notice that the mantra is very reflective. The first line mirrors the second line, only with *ghe* instead of *khe*.

*Note sure if this is the right box format...*

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ghe</td> 
        <td>ta ghe</td> 
        <td>- ghe</td> 
        <td>dha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ghe</td> 
        <td>ta khe</td> 
        <td>- khe</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

### Variations

You can add some variation to this mantra by doubling up on the *ghe's* in certain positions. Here are two such places you can do so (at the start of each line of the mantra):

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>*ghe*ghe</td> 
        <td>ta ghe</td> 
        <td>- ghe</td> 
        <td>dha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>*ghe*ghe</td> 
        <td>ta khe</td> 
        <td>- khe</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

### Supplement

In the supplement, we will go over how to play a simple kirtan to some of the mantras we have learned thus far. We will start the kirtan with a slow paced kaherva rhythm from [Lesson 4](~lessons/four). We will then transition into a slow paced bhajani tala we just learned.

From there, we will transition back into a faster kaherva, and then end with a fast bhajani tala. All the while we will include tiahai's from [Lesson 3](~lessons/three).
