Review of the bols
Learning how to sing to the first mantra
Two new mantras

The next mantra we will learn is a variation of the mantra from [Lesson 1](/lessons/one.html). We are adding an additional matra to the first part of the mantra. We added a *khe* in to the second matra:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>ge</td> 
        <td>ge</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

Once you have mastered the first mantra and its variation, move onto the next:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>ti</td> 
        <td>khe</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>ge</td> 
        <td>ge</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
