In a kirtan, you will eventually reach a point where you are too fast to keep up (and keep all your fingers in one piece.) To play at high speeds, we play a four matra mantra which is simplified and rolls in on itself. It sounds as if the mantra ends with its own beginning. This helps in playing at seemingly high speeds.

For the rolling beat (sometimes called Drut Kaherva) we will learn today, we will need one new bol:

### New Bols

**dhei:** This is simply a synonym for *dhe*, which is *gha* and *ti*.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>dha -</td>
        <td>ti dha</td>
        <td>ti dha</td>
        <td>dhei dha</td>
    </tr>
</table>

As you can tell this is a fairly simple mantra with four matras and seven bols. The difficulty with this mantra, and any rolling beat at that, is to control the rhythm. Try practicing this beat with a set kartal speed and play to it.

The tendency is to go faster and faster, practice staying at one tempo. [KKSongs.org](http://kksongs.org/) has a four beat to play along to. Clip 4.1 on [this](http://kksongs.org/kartal/lesson04.html) page has a rhythm you can play along to.
