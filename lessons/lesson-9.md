Lopha Tala is typically called a "two beat," which is bit of a misnomer. It is actually a three beat tala with the third beat being silent. This mantra is typically used during the damodarastakam prayers

Some things to note about this mantra. For starters, it is very cyclical on the Daya. Throughout the entire mantra, *- tak ta* is played. Secondly, this is a fairly simple mantra; the only difficult aspect is the timing.

Lets take a look at the new bol:

### Daya Bols

**tak:** A synonym for *ti.* 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>tak</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
    </tr>

        <td>khikhi</td> 
        <td>tak</td> 
        <td>jha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ge</td> 
        <td>dhe</td> 
        <td>na</td>

    <tr>
        <td>ge</td> 
        <td>dhe</td> 
        <td>na</td> 
    </tr>
</table>


### Variations

To add a little variation to the mantra, you can add an extra *ghe* in two locations. You can add it at the start of matra six, or matra ten.
