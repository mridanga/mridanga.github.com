The next mantra we will learn is called Prabhupada Tala. (*Check this for truthfullness*) This style of mantra was the first mantra taught to Srila Prabhupada by his father. Not coincidentally, this class of mantra is extremely popular and often heard during the slow to medium portions of kirtans.

Prabhupada Tala is 16 matras long, twice as long as kaherva. Again, the best way to approach this is to break the mantra into lines and practice them one at a time.
