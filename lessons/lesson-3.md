Tihais are analogous to fills in modern drumming. They are mantras peppered in sparingly into cyclic rhythms to add variety. They are typically inserted to the end of a line, mantra, or song. For the tihai we are learning today, we will need one additional bol. 

### New Bols

**jha:**
This is a synonym for *dha*. Remember, *dha* is a combination bol consisting of *ge* and *ta*.

## Suplement

In the supplement, we will learn how to use a tihai while playing in a kirtan. We will play 3 cycles of another mantra and then 1 cycle of the tihai. Here is what the entire song looks like in an expanded form:

<table>

    <tr>
        <td>ta</td>
        <td>khe</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>khe</td>
        <td>ta</td>
        <td>ge</td>
        <td>ge</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>jha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>jha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>jha</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe ta</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

    ta khe - -
    khe ta ge ge

    ta khe - -
    khe ta ge ge

    ta khe - -
    khe ta ge ge

    ta khe ta jha
    ta khe ta jha
    ta khe ta -

First we will just play it, then we will sing with it
