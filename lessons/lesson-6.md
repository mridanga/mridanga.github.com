More practice to sing while playing prabhupada tala with some tihas


This will help get through the fast part of a kirtan. This is called double time, take what you know and play it twice as fast (quick and dirty). A proper way is a derived mantra of prabhupada tala.

This is a modified version of the first part of prabhupada tala

    khe - khe ti ge dha



<table>
    <tr>
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>khe ti</td> 
        <td>ge dha</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

is the origional

the new mantra

    khe ta khe ti ge dha

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe ti</td> 
        <td>ge dha</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
