More practice to sing while playing prabhupada tala with some tihas

So far we have covered how to play during the slow portions of a kirtan with either Prabhupada Tala in [Lesson 5](~lessons/five) or the mantras from [Lesson 1](~lessons/one) and [Lesson 2](~lessons/two.hml). When the kirtan progresses to a medium pace, the basic kaherva mantra from [Lesson 4](~lessons/four) will fit nicely. 

However, it can be hard to keep up when kirtans get exceptionally fast. For this last portion of the kirtan, we will introduce a new mantra. This mantra is in double time. Essentially you take what you know and play it twice as fast (quick and dirty way to define double time). A proper way to play in double time is to use a mantra derived from Prabhupada Tala.

First, lets take the origional first line of Prabhupada Tala from [Lesson 5](~lessons/five):

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>-</td> 
        <td>khe ti</td> 
        <td>ge dha</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

Now, replace the second matra which was a pause, and insert a *ta*:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>khe</td> 
        <td>ta</td> 
        <td>khe ti</td> 
        <td>ge dha</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
