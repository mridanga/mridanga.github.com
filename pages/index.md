# Learning mridanga

This will be a resource (*hopefully*) that aggregates all the mridanga lessons out there for newcomers to learn the instrument.

## Notes:

- It would be pretty cool if you hovered over a note it would give you synonyms + how to play the note

- Anything in boxes is probably wrong. I just tried to fit them in how they sounded
