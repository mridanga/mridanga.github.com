The bols are broken up into three main categories and subdivided into two sub-categories. First, bols are separated on which face they are played. Secondly, bols are divided on if they produce an open, resonant noise or a closed, non-resonant noise.

A trick to remember combination bols is to look at the last few letters of the name. Bols ending in 'a' typically are open (i.e. *ta*) on the Daya. For example, *dha*, *jha*, *gha*, all are played with *ta.*

If a bol has a synonym, it will appear in [brackets].

##Dayan Bols: (Small End)
**Open**

- **ta:** Strike the syahi with index
- **na:** Strike inner rim with index (synonym for *ta* in most cases)

**Closed**

- **ra:** Scoop with index hit the upper half of the syahi, closed ta
- **ti:** Scoop last 3 fingers and hit the bottom half of the syahi
- **ri:** A closed version of *ta*. Strike the syahi with the index finger
- **te:** Middle finger on the center

##Baya Bols: (Large End)

**Open**

- **gha:** *[ge, ghe, ghi]*
- **ga:** *[gi]*: Use palm to mute the tone some, cobra strike with middle/index
- **gin:** *[ga]*: With a sliding palm

**Closed**

- **ka:** *[khe, ki]*:
    - Soft: Normal open hand strike on the syahi, palm does not hit
    - Loud: Use the second pair of knuckles to hit center of the syahi

## Combined (Both Ends)

**Open**

- **dha:** *ghe* + *ta*
- **jha:** *ghe* + *-ta*: The ta is very slightly delayed. This can be substituted with *dha* for the most part

**Closed**

- **kat:** *ka* + *ti*

**Mixed**

- **dhe:** *[dhin]* *gha* + *ti*
- **Ta:** *ka* + *ta*
